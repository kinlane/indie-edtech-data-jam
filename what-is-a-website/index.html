<h1>What Is A Website?</h1>

<p>A website is a collection of documents that live on a computer somewhere in the world, that is connected to the Internet, that has an address assigned to, allowing individual website domains (aka. .coms) to be pointed to a specific document, within that folder, on that computer connected to the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>A Website Always Begins With A Domain, Your Domain</strong></p>
<p>A website begins with you purchasing a domain name. In the early days all domains ended with .com, but today, there is almost any top level domain you can imagine. Anyone can purchase a domain, I recommend using a domain registrar named Hover, a service that allows you you to purchase any available name, and manage the detail of where your domain will live. It also includes the basics like running email for your domain.</p>

<p><strong>Where Is The Computer Will Host Your Website(s)?</strong></p>
Where will your website live? There are thousands of ways you can publish and host your website. The goal is to find a host that will allow you to setup your basic website, expand and grow the amount of data, content, and other media for your web site. Ideally your host will let you manage the setup, configuration, and maintenance of many sites, within your domain. I recommend Reclaim Hosting, which is the most forward thinking ISP in operation today, when it comes to the concept of taking control of your digital presence.</p>

<p>Each hosting provider will have a different setup for the computers they run, and connect to the cloud. I run Linux servers, within the Amazon Web Services cloud platform. I use an open source web server software called Apache to deliver web sites on my Linux servers. To setup a new website, all I do is create a new folder, add a new entry to the configuration file for Apache Web Server, restart the service, and my basic website is up, and waiting for visitors.</p>

<p><strong>DNS Is How You Connect Your Domain To Your Host</strong></p>
We have a domain, we know where our website(s) will live, and have created the folder for our new website, including configuring the Apache web server to accept visitors for my domain. Before the rest of the Internet will be able to find my web website, I have to use DNS to connect my domain to the IP address of the web server I have setup and configured. All I need is a new DNS (A record), which tells my domain the IP address of my website hosting provider. Providers like Reclaim Hosting help you with DNS, hosting, and other issues you will encounter.</p>
