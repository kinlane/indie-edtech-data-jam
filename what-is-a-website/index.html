<h1>What Is A Website?</h1>
<p>A website is a collection of documents that live on a computer somewhere in the world, that is connected to the Internet, that has an address assigned to, allowing individual website domains (aka. .coms) to be pointed to a specific document, within that folder, on that computer connected to the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>A Website Always Begins With A Domain, Your Domain</strong></p>
<p>A website begins with you purchasing a domain name. In the early days all domains ended with .com, but today, there is almost any top level domain you can imagine. Anyone can purchase a domain, I recommend using a domain registrar named Hover, who will allow you to purchase any available name, and manage the detail of where your domain will live.</p>
