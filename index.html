<h1>Indie EdTech and The Personal API</h1>
<p>I wanted to pull together a toolbox that I could use throughout the conversations I would be having at Davidson College this week, that would help folks understand what an APIs, their relationship to the web and mobile world we depend on each day.</p>
<p>Let's look at the world of APIs around you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why APIs?</strong> - You are using APIs every day to pay for things at the store, to taking pictures with Instagram, and sharing on Facebook, all the way to doing your online banking. The more you understand this world of APIs, the more successful you will be in your personal, and professional career--able to take control over more of your digial presence.<li>
<li><strong>What is a website?</strong> - A website is a folder on a computer that is plugged into the Internet, that is given an Internet address, with a domain or subdomain that allows anyone with the address to find it on the Internet--<a href="websites/">let's explore the basics of what is a website >></a><li>
<li><strong>What is an API?</strong> - <li>
<li><strong>The History of APIs</strong> - <li>
<li><strong>The Programmable Web</strong> - <li>
<li><strong>The University API</strong> - <li>
<li><strong>The Personal API</strong> - <li>
<li><strong>Some APIs In Your World</strong> - <li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop runs as a simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript website that runs as a Github repository, using Jekyll and Github Pages. You can fork the project, and play with any of the examples here on this, or your own version running in your Github account.</p>
<p>This project is created by the API Evangelist, Kin Lane. If you have any questions, you can tweet at me via @kinlane or @apievangelist, or use the Github Issues for this project.</p>
