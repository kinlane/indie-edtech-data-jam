<h1>Indie EdTech and The Personal API</h1>
<p>I wanted to pull together a toolbox that I could use throughout the conversations I would be having at Davidson College this week, that would help folks understand what an APIs, their relationship to the web and mobile world we depend on each day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why APIs?</strong> - You are using APIs every day to pay for things at the store, taking pictures with Instagram, all the way to banking online. The more you understand this world of APIs, the more successful you will be in your personal, and professional career, empowering you to to take more control over more of your digial self.</li>
<li><strong><a href="websites/">What is a website?</a></strong> - A website is a folder on a computer that is plugged into the Internet, that is given an Internet address, with a domain or subdomain that allows anyone with the address to find it on the Internet.</li>
<li><a href="content-negotiation/"><strong>What is an API?</strong></a> - A API is just like a website, except that instead of returning HTML for humans, it returns RSS, XML, JSON, and other machine readable formats meant for other applications.</li>
<li><a href="history/"><strong>The History of APIs</strong></a> - Web APIs have a history, a little shorter than that of the web itself, beggining in 2000, from a a PHD students doctoral thesis.</li>
<li><a href="programmable-web/"><strong>The Programmable Web</strong></a> - APIs are not just about serving up content, data and other resources for use in applications and devices. HTTP allows APIs to be used for reading, as well as writing, making the web programmable, not just something we consume.</li>
<li><a href="university-api/"><strong>The University API</strong></a> - In 2016, APIs are making their way onto campus in several ways. Sometimes it is campus IT leading the way, others come from vendors selling software on campus, from faculty making it part of their regular work or courses, and is also being brought in by the students.</li>
<li><a href="personal-api/"><strong>The Personal API</strong></a> - Amidst all of this, there is a new concept emerging that is centered around you. It is being dubbed the personal API, leveraging an awareness of all things APIs, allowing you to take more control over yourself, the content and data you generate online, in your course work, and in your future career.</li>
<li><a href="apis/"><strong>Some APIs In Your World</strong></a> - Let's explore just a handful of APIs that are making an impact in your world, and learn about some of their details.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop runs as a simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript website that runs as a Github repository, using Jekyll and Github Pages. You can fork the project, and play with any of the examples here on this, or your own version running in your Github account.</p>
<p>This project is created by the API Evangelist, Kin Lane. If you have any questions, you can tweet at me via @kinlane or @apievangelist, or use the Github Issues for this project.</p>
